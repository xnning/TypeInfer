\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we present how to do unification easily for simple dependent types using
a strategy called \textit{type sanitization}. This strategy is then extended to
deal with subtyping in a language with restricted polymorphic types.
In the
feature, we plan to finish the sketch proofs for those conjectures. And we are
going to extend the algorithm to deal with more features, including system with
general polymorphism, higher kinds and so on.
