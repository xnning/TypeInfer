\section{Introduction}

Contributions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{A strategy called \textit{type sanitization}} that helps resolve
  the dependency between existential variables in the context, which strengthens
  the approach of type inference in context to be applicable to more advanced
  features, such as dependent types.
\item \textbf{A specification of a unification algorithm} for dependent type
  systems with controls over type-level computations and first-order
  constraints. The algorithm is remarkably simple and predictable.
\item \textbf{A replacement of the higher-rank type instantiation} for an
  implicitly polymorphic type system with higher rank types
  \citep{dunfield2013complete} . The design of \textit{polymorphic type
    sanitization} simplifies the subtyping for existential variables, and also
  removes the problem of duplication in original instantiation.
