\section{Introduction}

Contributions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{A strategy called \textit{type sanitization}} that helps resolve
  the dependency between existential variables in the context, which simplifies
  but also strengthens the approach of type inference in context
  \citep{gundry2010type} so that information increase can be reasoned in a more
  syntactic way to ease the meta-theory proving. Also, we show that our strategy
  is applicable to advanced features, such as dependent types.
\item \textbf{A specification of a unification algorithm} for dependent type
  systems with controls over type-level computations and first-order
  constraints. The algorithm is remarkably simple and predictable. We prove that
  the algorithm is sound and complete.
\item \textbf{A replacement of the higher-rank type instantiation} for an
  implicitly polymorphic type system with higher rank types
  \citep{dunfield2013complete}. The design of \textit{polymorphic type
    sanitization} simplifies the subtyping for existential variables, and also
  removes the problem of duplication in original instantiation, while preserves
  the completeness and soundness of subtyping.
