\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose a new strategy \textit{type sanitization}, and present
two applications of this strategy. The first application is type sanitization in
a unification algorithm for a dependent type system with alpha-equality based
first order constrains. And the second one is in a subtyping algorithm for a
higher rank polymorphic type system with the extended \textit{polymorphic type
  sanitization}.

We expect type sanitization is applicable to more type systems with other
advanced features, for example, intersection types and more advanced
forms of dependent types.
